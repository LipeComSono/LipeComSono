Hi! My name is Felipe, I'm 17 years old, I can speak Portuguese ( Brazil ) and English but I'm not fluent.
I'm learning JavaScript, Python and React Native.
About my future with a Professional Dev, I want to learn PHP, SQL, C and C++ and to evolve my English.
I want to work in the Back-End because HTML and CSS is so 'meeeh' for me.
so is this, tks for read and bye.
